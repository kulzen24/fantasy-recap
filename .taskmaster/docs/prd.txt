# LLM-Powered Fantasy Football Recap Generator

## 1. Objective

To create a web-based application that generates personalized, insightful, and engaging fantasy football recaps using Large Language Models (LLMs). The application will connect to major fantasy platforms and leverage user-provided templates to match their writing style.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1. User Authentication & Management
- Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) with Google, Yahoo, ESPN, and Sleeper (if possible).
- No direct user credentials (passwords) will be stored in the application's database.
- Users can manage their connected accounts and settings.

### 2.2. Fantasy Platform Integration
- Connect to Yahoo, ESPN, and Sleeper fantasy football leagues via their official APIs.
- Securely handle authentication (OAuth) and data retrieval for league information, rosters, matchups, and scoring data.
- The system should be able to pull data from the current week and previous weeks to build historical context.

### 2.3. LLM Integration & Configuration
- Support multiple LLM providers: OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), and Google (Gemini).
- Users must provide their own API keys for the desired LLM service.
- API keys will be stored in the database using strong, best-practice encryption methods.

### 2.4. Recap Generation Engine
- Users can upload samples of their previous recaps to serve as a stylistic template for the LLM, ensuring the tone and voice are consistent.
- The service will analyze data from connected leagues to identify key insights, such as:
    - Top performers and underachievers.
    - Close matchups vs. blowouts.
    - Notable player performances (e.g., bench players outscoring starters).
    - Multi-week trends (e.g., winning/losing streaks, consistent high scores).
- Users can initiate recap generation from the web front end and provide specific parameters or prompts.

### 2.5. Web Frontend
- The user interface design should be clean, modern, and inspired by the ChatGPT interface.
- It will feature a main dashboard to view connected leagues, access past recaps, and generate new ones.
- A recap editor will allow users to review, edit, and save the LLM-generated content.

### 2.6. Data Storage
- A SQL database will be used to store:
    - User account information (linked to SSO).
    - Encrypted user API keys.
    - Information about connected fantasy leagues.
    - Generated and edited recaps.
    - User-defined weekly awards.

### 2.7. Custom Weekly Awards
- Users can create and define their own set of weekly awards (e.g., "Team of the Week", "Most Tragic Loss").
- The system will track these awards and can incorporate them into the generated recaps.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** All sensitive data, especially API keys and authentication tokens, must be handled with the utmost security.
- **Usability:** The interface should be intuitive for users who may not be technically savvy.
- **Reliability:** The service should be stable and reliably fetch data from the fantasy league APIs.
